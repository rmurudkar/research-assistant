Use the simplest possible language and focus only on the core idea, stripping away technical complexity while preserving accuracy. This should be understandable to a non-expert.""",

        "Balanced": """Response Style: Provide a moderately detailed explanation of 1-2 paragraphs that bridges simplicity and depth. Begin with an accessible overview anyone could understand, then add a layer of more specific details. Use one simple analogy or example to illustrate the concept. Define key terms that are essential to understanding.""",

        "Detailed": """Response Style: Provide a thorough explanation that fully addresses the complexity while ensuring accessibility. Structure your response with clear sections for different aspects of the concept. Include:
        1) A simple overview for beginners
        2) More nuanced details for those with some background
        3) Practical examples or analogies that illustrate the concept
        4) Definitions of technical terms in plain language
        5) Connections to related concepts within the paper""",

        1) Start with a "simplest possible explanation" that anyone could understand
        2) Progressively build in complexity through clearly marked sections
        3) Use multiple complementary examples and analogies
        4) Create "mental hooks" that connect new concepts to familiar ideas
        5) Explain how experts think about this concept vs. how beginners might approach it
        6) Address potential misconceptions or confusion points
        7) Include a brief "key takeaways" summary at the end that reinforces core concepts

        Organize this longer response with descriptive subheadings and visual language. Your goal is to make the reader feel like they've gained genuine insight into something that initially seemed beyond their understanding."""
