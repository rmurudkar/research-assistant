# Sample data based on the provided example
sample_data = """FROM: Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs)
TO: Neuronal differentiation
RELATIONSHIP: GNPs enhance the expression of neuronal markers MAP2, Nestin, and Tuj1, promoting the differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) into neurons.

FROM: GNP concentration
TO: Cell viability
RELATIONSHIP: Lower concentrations of GNPs maintained cell viability, whereas higher concentrations were detrimental to hBMSCs.

FROM: 0.4 ¬µg/ml GNP coating
TO: Morphological changes
RELATIONSHIP: This specific concentration leads to observable morphological changes and increased fluorescence in hBMSC cultures, indicating enhanced differentiation.

FROM: Calcium imaging with Fluo4-AM
TO: Neuronal activity assessment
RELATIONSHIP: This method is used to show increased neuronal activity, underscoring GNPs' role in neuronal maturation.

FROM: GNPs
TO: Axon guidance pathway activation
RELATIONSHIP: GNPs influence the axon guidance pathway, among others, driving mechanisms involved in neuronal differentiation.

FROM: GNPs + Gelatin coating
TO: Neuronal differentiation enhancement
RELATIONSHIP: The combination provides a synergistic environment that supports effective neuronal differentiation of hBMSCs.

FROM: MTT assay
TO: GNP cytotoxicity evaluation
RELATIONSHIP: The assay shows that higher concentrations of GNPs lead to reduced cell viability, reinforcing the importance of optimizing GNP dosage for cell culture applications.

FROM: Lentiviral transduction with LeGO-G2-PURO
TO: GFP tracking of differentiation
RELATIONSHIP: The use of GFP-expressing hBMSCs allows for long-term tracking of neuronal differentiation under different conditions.

FROM: GNP concentration
TO: MAP2 expression
RELATIONSHIP: Higher GNP concentrations result in increased MAP2 expression, indicating enhanced neuronal differentiation.

FROM: GNP treatment
TO: Tuj1 expression
RELATIONSHIP: GNPs significantly increase Tuj1 expression across different concentrations, supporting the continuation of neuronal differentiation.

FROM: Gelatin and GNP coatings
TO: Enhanced fluorescence intensity
RELATIONSHIP: Both coatings, especially at 0.4 ¬µg/ml GNP, promote increased fluorescence intensity, indicating neuronal differentiation.

FROM: GNP coating
TO: Calcium signaling
RELATIONSHIP: GNP coatings enhance calcium responses in differentiated neurons, reflecting their functional maturation and excitability.

FROM: ATP stimulation
TO: Ca2+ signaling enhancement
RELATIONSHIP: ATP-induced Ca2+ transients are stronger with gelatin and GNP coatings, suggesting enhanced signaling responses in differentiated neurons."""
